This report houses all the build notes and python code that I am using to convert the convertible roof stow and extend cycles from the analog/limitswitch based 1967 original setup to a process run by a Raspberry Pi with a digital I/O extenstion board plus relays. 


Timeline for this project is end of summer 2018...or so :)
